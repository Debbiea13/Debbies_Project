    Issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.  There are many disabilities, but here are some that websites can overcome, 
    
    
    People with visual impairments face challenges in the lack of compatibility of Web content with screen readers.  Screen-reader users have problems when text tags on graphics, links, forms, or tables are not applied. 
    
    For people with limited or no use of fingers or hands, the barriers are created by cluttered layout, buttons and links that are too small to navigate,
    
    For people with hearing impairments, the lack of textual equivalents of audio content can cut off large portions of the content of a site, and interactive Web chats and other conferencing features may be impossible. 
    
    People with speech and communication impairments can also be excluded from interactive Web chats and other conferencing features. 
    
    For persons with cognitive impairments, such as autism, dementia, or traumatic brain injury, issues of design, layout, and navigability are the difference between being able to use a site and not being able to use it. 
    
    To overcome these issues developers can design their websites to be accessible from the very beginning as there are no additional costs involved. 
    
    If a Web site uses a content management system, often the page templates can be edited very quickly, so that the page layout itself is accessible. Then, itâ€™s only up to the content developers to make sure that they have labeled their pictures and provided closed-captioning or a transcript on multimedia. 
    
    Although all people with disabilities may be affected by inaccessible Web sites, those who are blind or have low vision are often the most affected. Computer interfaces are still primarily visual, and when the non visual equivalents are not coded properly, blind or low-vision individuals may have access to none of the content. 
    
    For people with hearing impairments most content can be accessible, except for the audio, so we need to provide transcripts or captioning. 
    
    People with motor impairments, who may be unable to use standard keyboards or mice, may have trouble using websites that have content that is reachable only by using a pointing devices. Many of the design features that help blind users also help people with motor impairments.
