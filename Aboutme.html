<h1>About me

<p>
<h3>Born and bred in Bristol, I am married with two adult children. I enjoy family get- togethers, holidays and exercising, especially yoga, swimming and walking.
</p>
<p>
After leaving school I took a clerical course which led me to work in Wills Tobacco Factory and Offices. I worked there for 10 years but when I started a family I left and started work at a local primary school as the hours suited bringing up my children. As my children got older, I realised I enjoyed technology, so thought it was about time I updated my skills.
</p>
<p>        
I took a typewriting course and the tutor said to me, “you need to go on a computer course, typewriting by itself is going to be a thing of the past”.  So, I took a few computer courses such as CLAIT, IBT, and City & Guilds which I really enjoyed. I started volunteering as a Learning Support Assistant, then took a Teacher Training Course. This led me to my present job as an IT Tutor facilitating IT courses ranging from Entry level to level 2.

I enjoy my job but have had the feeling lately that I need to learn something new, so when the Coding Development 19 Course came up, I jumped at the chance. Can’t wait to see where it takes me next...............
