    Once your website is complete it is protected as soon as it goes “live” on a server, there is no need to register.  It is good practice to mark your web pages with the copyright sign to act as a reminder, include your name and date. You might want to register your website, this is not a requirement, it is up to you.  If your website is valuable to you then you may feel the need to protect its content for legal reasons. [2] [3]
<p> When creating a website you will always have constraints affecting the development and final project.  Budget and deadlines are two of the main constraints also client and audience, you are creating a website that needs to be user friendly and attractive to an audience, not you.[1]</p>
