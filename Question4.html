<h3>
Risks that might impact digital projects and cause them to fail are poor project management and poor communications. People need to be kept informed about changes, standards, requirements and schedule. By setting up a good communication system and keeping to a schedule you give your project less chance of failure.
</p>
<p>Plan your project but be ready for Murphy’s Law “If anything can go wrong it will”. Using the latest technology can be tempting but projects have enough risks without introducing something you know nothing about.
</p>
<p>
Inadequate testing can cause your project to fail, it might work when you use it but getting someone else to test it who knows less or more than you can save time, making changes before it is launched.
</p>
<p>If you are working in a team, ensure the right task goes to the right person by giving the wrong person a task will only cause friction and time.
