<h3>   
Planning and carrying out tasks using IT I will first look at other websites to see different designs and ways that have been used to take the user to the next point of interest. 
<br>
I will think of a couple of themes for my website and research images and layouts then make up my mind which theme to use. 
I will think of font styles and colours, do I want any videos, music or links to other sites if I have time.
</p>
<p>
Making my website I can use a Trello board to plan ideas, how the website will look and how the user will interact with it. I can create deadlines for myself and prioritise tasks.
