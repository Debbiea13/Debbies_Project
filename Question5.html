<h1>

how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?

<h3>
To select and use the correct IT systems and software first I would read through the brief/scenario.  I would then decide which software would be the most efficient to use for my skills and knowledge.  Sometimes this might not be the best software but it would be better for me to use a system that I know rather than try to find my way around a improved software that I knew nothing about.  This would be time consuming and frustrating.

For example:  Scenario - You have been tasked with making a text-based adventure game. This game can be themed however you like but must have multiple paths that the user can take. Before we start coding, you need to plan out exactly what is going to happen in the game.  
</p>
<p>
I would know that to write code I can use Visual Studio Code to create a Python file where I would be able to create a text based game.  From experience I know that planning is important so I would create a flowchart using draw.io or something similar and use project management software tool - Trello board.
