<h3>  
Using Trello has helped me plan ahead, make notes and prioritise my work.  My tutor can check my work as I build my website and I can make any adjustments/changes straight away.  At the end of the day I can leave myself notes telling myself what I need to do first thing and give myself deadlines to finish tasks.  
</p>
<p>
I have researched Git and GitHub and worked through a tutorial but I don’t feel confident enough to use it at the moment.  As I understand it - 
Git - Once you have downloaded git, create an account. Then you can work on your code from your computer
GitHub - You upload your code from Git to the GitHub on the cloud, where you share your code with others who can make changes/edit your code.
