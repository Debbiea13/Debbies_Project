<par>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page

<br>The content and layout for my website needs to be pleasing to look at and easy to read.  Body text should be a size that can be read with headings and sub heading larger or underlined/bold so that they stand out from the main body.  My content for each page will have answers to questions regarding IT tools, working in teams, looking at my strengths and weaknesses of my final project and how I could improve next time.  Also, how I could use different methods, skills and planning to improve productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making 
your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, 
Trello
<br>In making my own website I have enjoyed using a MacBook Air, I usually use Windows and have only used a MacBook occasionally so it was a new experience but I soon adapted.  Using Visual Code and Trello were also new to me, I found Visual Studio Code easy to use and understood how to make files and folders, the terminal was new when using Python files but I found it user friendly.  Trello has been a valuable tool, making lists and checking them off has been very useful in keeping to deadlines. Slack instant messaging system was useful to keep in touch with my tutor and team members.  Zoom was used for video conferencing and screen sharing to help problem solve.  
<br>I would change my approach when using Trello next time, I completed the board each morning and evening but I would complete the board throughout the day next time as tasks were missed. For video conferencing I would try Skype or Google Hangouts only because Zoom did  cause problems when teams got together as the call only lasted 40 minutes to 1 hour, we were on a free subscription and needed to keep re booking meetings.</p>
<p>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, 
    Trello  
<br>As this is my first experience on coding and building websites I don’t know of any other coding programs so I have found that using Visual Studio Code has been an appropriate program for me to start from.  It is user friendly when using .HTML/.CSS andseems to work well when viewing potential web pages.  
Trello did the job it was free to use and easy to share with my tutor, Slack was a valuable communication tool for keeping in touch with each other, sharing files and links.</p>
<p>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with 
    your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the 
    interests of openness. What would you change?
<br>I am happy that I have been able to create a website from scratch and adapt it, make changes and improve it.  But I still do not have the skills to make a professional looking website, this is probably due to time constraints.  If I had more time I could do more research and practice more so that I felt confident to use more of the .css program.  I would have made some important text bold or a different colour but experience and time were not on my side.
<br>
The website is working and looks good but it was difficult to decide on colours, what others would find pleasing to look at and easy to read.  I spent too much time on trying to centre a heading and trying to move a picture.  I should have researched websites before I started the project not whilst I was doing the project.</p>
<p> 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project  
<br>   
Further improvements to my project would be to have a menu down the side of the homepage so that the user could decide which page they wanted to look at without having to click onto every page until they got to the one they wanted.  I would add keyboard commands for people with disabilities so that they could access the website easier and I would look at different colours that could be used to help the visually impaired.</p>
<p>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose 
<br>  
    Outcomes have been achieved and match requirement although more work on the website could have been done if time constrains were not an issue but I fear this is always the case.  The website is fit for purpose it is a working website but understandably needs more work done to it.</p>
<p>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review)</p>
<p>  
    3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of 
    productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your 
    website? How? Could you have done it in teams?  
<br> 
    Drawbacks of using IT tools and systems are that you are sat down for very long periods of time staring at a screen.  This can cause back and neck ache, eye strain and headaches.  
<br>
    Working in a team to create my website would have been beneficial because other team members would have brought more skills to the project.  We would have talked about colour schemes, layouts and images for the website whereas working alone you need to make these decisions alone. 
<br>
    For me I have learnt a lot more working alone because I had to do all of the research myself and make notes myself so it feels like learning has stuck a little more as I couldn’t rely on anyone but myself.</p>
<p>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency  
<br>    
    To improve productivity and efficiency I would buy a subscription for Zoom if working in teams as a lot of time was spent waiting for someone to set up a meeting not knowing who’s turn it was or who wanted to do it.  If a subscription wasn’t an option I would set up a rota on Trello for setting up each meeting.
<br>    
    Taking more short breaks, drinking more water and taking part in exercise would definitely improve my productivity and efficiency, all of these things tend to get forgotten when you are intrigued with what you are doing!
<br>
    3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what 
    would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?  
<br>    
    Next time I would organise myself better, type up my notes put them in some order so that I didn’t need to keep searching for tips.  I would plan my design for my website before I started so that I could visualise it then make changes as I went.  If working in a team I would be more assertive and not rely so much on others to do tasks I couldn’t do but research them and have a go.</p>
<p>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions 
<br>    
    Getting other people to try your website is one of the best ways to test if it is working correctly.  If you can get people with less knowledge on using websites this is even better because they will come across problems that you might have thought people would be able to work out but in practice it doesn’t work.
<br>    
    Getting feedback from colleagues on how the website flows and looks is good although everyone will have different suggestions at the end of the day it is up to you! </p>
