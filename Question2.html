To complete a digital project successfully you will need computer skills, knowledge of using websites, communication platforms e.g. Slack/Microsoft Teams/WhatsApp/Facebook and/or video conferencing. Communication skills are important whether it be oral or written and creativity along with problem solving will help you to make any changes along the way. Planning skills and time management are also important.

You will need resources such as I T equipment – Hardware, software, a computer, printer, Internet connection and web cam. Using tools like Trello to plan and organise your work will help you stay on track, if working with others you can see who is working on what and what stage they are at in one glance.  You will need to plan your project, maybe discuss your project with like-minded people or your tutor.
